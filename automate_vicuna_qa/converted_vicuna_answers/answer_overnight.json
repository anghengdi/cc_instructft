QUESTION: Who discovered the law of universal gravitation?\nANSWER: The law of universal gravitation was discovered by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century.\n\nExplanation: The law of universal gravitation states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Newton formulated this law while studying the planets' movement around the sun and realized that there was a quantifiable force directing them towards the sun. He published his book titled \"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\" in 1687, where he described the law of universal gravitation in detail.\n\nScore: 10\n\n2.

    "text": "1. QUESTION: What is the purpose of instruction tuning in the Vicuna model?\nANSWER: The purpose of instruction tuning in the Vicuna model is to evaluate zero-shot performance on task clusters that the model has not seen during pre-training. This is done by instruction-tuning on all other clusters, except for the one being evaluated.\n2. QUESTION: How is the output space for a given task handled in the Vicuna model?\nANSWER: The output space for a given task in the Vicuna model is either one of several classes (classification) or free text (generation). Since the Vicuna model is an instruction-tuned version of a decoder-only language model, it naturally responds in free text, and no further modifications are needed for generation tasks. For classification tasks, prior work used a rank classification approach, but the Vicuna model includes an options suffix to make the model aware of which choices are desired when responding to classification tasks.\n3. QUESTION: How is the model architecture and pretraining of the Vicuna model described in the text?\nANSWER: The model architecture and pretraining of the Vicuna model are described as using Lambda-PT, a dense left-to-right, decoder-only transformer language model of 137 billion parameters. This model is pretrained on a collection of web documents, including those with computer code, dialog data, and Wikipedia, tokenized into 2.\n4. QUESTION: What is the purpose of the read. comp. with commonsense cluster in the Vicuna model?\nANSWER: The purpose of the read. comp. with commonsense cluster in the Vicuna model is to evaluate zero-shot performance on commonsense reasoning tasks.

QUESTION: How is the evaluation of zero-shot performance on task clusters handled in the Vicuna model?\nANSWER: The evaluation of zero-shot performance on task clusters in the Vicuna model involves instruction-tuning on the task clusters that the model has not seen during pre-training. This is done by holding out a different task cluster for evaluation.\n6. QUESTION: What is the purpose of the options suffix in the Vicuna model?\nANSWER: The purpose of the options suffix in the Vicuna model is to make the model aware of which choices are desired when responding to classification tasks. This is done by appending the token options to the end of a classification task along with a list of the output classes for that task.\n7. QUESTION: How is the Vicuna model different from prior work in classification tasks?\nANSWER: The Vicuna model is different from prior work in classification tasks in that it includes an options suffix, which makes the model aware of which choices are desired when responding to classification tasks. This is logically sound, but prior work used a rank classification approach, in which only two outputs (e.g., \"yes\" and \"no\") were considered, and the higher probability one was taken as the model's prediction.\n8. QUESTION: What is the purpose of the Lambda-PT model architecture in the Vicuna model?\nANSWER: The purpose of the Lambda-PT model architecture in the Vicuna model is to provide a dense left-to-right, decoder-only transformer language model of 137 billion parameters for pretraining on a collection of web documents, including those with computer code, dialog data, and Wikipedia, tokenized into 2.\n9.

    "text": "1. QUESTION: What is the main advantage of instruction-tuning over conventional non-instruction-tuned models?\nANSWER: Instruction-tuning is more computationally expensive than single-task finetuning, but it is a one-time cost. On the other hand, pretrained models that require extensive finetuning become more costly when aggregating over many millions of additional training steps. Therefore, instruction-tuned models offer a promising solution to significantly reduce the amount of finetuning steps across a wide range of tasks, if they are adopted as a new standard starting point for single-task finetuning.\n2. QUESTION: What is the tradition in the field of NLP that has a long history?\nANSWER: The practice of pretraining one general-purpose language representation that is useful for multiple downstream tasks has a long tradition that goes back at least to Mikolov et al. (2013) and Dai and Le (2015).\n3. QUESTION: What did Peters et al. (2018) and Devlin et al. (2019) do in the field of NLP?\nANSWER: Peters et al. (2018) and Devlin et al. (2019) cemented the paradigm of pretraining a large model on a large unsupervised corpus, and the field of NLP quickly converged to using these models, which substantially outperform the prior art of non-pretrained ask-specific LSTM models on all tasks.\n4. QUESTION: What was the dominant way to access the high-quality syntactic and semantic knowledge encoded in pretrained models before instruction-tuning?\nANSWER: The dominant way to access the high-quality syntactic and semantic knowledge encoded in pretrained models was not to prompt them with instructions but to add an additional task-specific linear layer that maps the model activations into numerical class labels.\n5. QUESTION: What did Radford et al. (2019), Raffel et al. (2020), and Lewis et al. (2020) do in the field of NLP?\nANSWER: Radford et al. (2019), Raffel et al. (2020), and Lewis et al. (2020) popularized the notion that downstream tasks and multiple tasks can be jointly learned by directly using the pretrained LM head to generate the answers in natural language, the task-general nature of these generative models became the precursor to many multitask transfer learning studies, which in turn led to the first wave of instruction-using as described in section 2.\n6. QUESTION: What is the main advantage of using pretrained language models as the foundation of instruction-tuning?\nANSWER: Using pretrained language models as the foundation of instruction-tuning offers a promising solution to significantly reduce the amount of finetuning steps across a wide range of tasks, if they are adopted as a new standard starting point for single-task finetuning.\n7. QUESTION: What is the impact of the continuing advancement in research on the pretraining corpora, architectures, and pretraining objectives of LMS on instruction-tuning?\nANSWER: The continuing advancement in research on the pretraining corpora, architectures, and pretraining objectives of LMS also has a large impact on instruction-tuning.\n8. QUESTION: What is the main disadvantage of conventional non-instruction-tuned models?\nANSWER: Conventional non-instruction-tuned models are more computationally expensive than single-task finetuning, and the cost is not a one-time expense, but rather an ongoing cost that increases with the number of additional training steps.\n9. QUESTION: What is the main advantage of using task-specific linear layers to access the high-quality syntactic and semantic knowledge encoded in pretrained models?\nANSWER: Using task-specific linear layers to access the high-quality syntactic and semantic knowledge encoded in pretrained models allows for the generation of numerical class labels, which is a task-specific way of accessing the knowledge.\n10.

    "text": "1. QUESTION: What is the impact of research on pretraining corpora, architectures, and pretraining objectives on instruction tuning?\nANSWER: The continuing advancement in research on the pretraining corpora, architectures, and pretraining objectives of LMS has a large impact on instruction tuning. As of 2022, decoder-only left-to-right causal transformers dominate the market of models larger than 100b, and all models of such size class with fully public model parameters are decoder-only.\n2. QUESTION: What is the decision-making process for choosing between decoder-only and fully public model parameters in LMS?\nANSWER: The decision of which model to choose is often due to better hardware and software framework support, but Raffel et al. (2020), Lewis et al. (2020), and Tay et al. (2022a) have consistently found that left-to-right causal language modeling is a suboptimal objective, and Tay et al. (2022b) and Wang et al. (2022a) showed that a mixture of non-sequential objectives is much superior for downstream tasks with zero-shot and few-shot prompting.\n3. QUESTION: What are the major developments in instruction tuning outlined in Section 2?\nANSWER: The major developments in instruction tuning include the prospect of complementing or replacing few-shot in-context learning, which is the currently predominant method of evaluating pretrained and instruction-tuned models, with parameter-efficient tuning.\n4. QUESTION: What is the prospect of complementing or replacing few-shot in-context learning in instruction tuning?\nANSWER: The prospect of complementing or replacing few-shot in-context learning with parameter-efficient tuning is promising, as updating a small subset of model parameters can reach comparable performance as fully tuning all model parameters.\n5. QUESTION: What are the challenges of standard finetuning of models larger than 100b?\nANSWER: The standard finetuning of models larger than 100b requires a high number of accelerators with the right interconnects, which is often too expensive even for many industry labs, leading to the need for parameter-efficient tuning.\n6. QUESTION: What is the relationship between pretraining corpora, instruction tuning, and downstream abilities?\nANSWER: The relationship between pretraining corpora, instruction tuning, and downstream abilities remains under-explored, and typically, public models are trained on one of a few public corpora: C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), the pile (Gao et al., 2020), or Roots (Laurencon et al., 2022).\n7. QUESTION: What are the important developments in instruction tuning?\nANSWER: The important developments in instruction tuning include the prospect of complementing or replacing few-shot in-context learning, the challenges of standard finetuning of models larger than 100b, and the relationship between pretraining corpora, instruction tuning, and downstream abilities.\n8. QUESTION: What is the impact of the decision to use decoder-only models on instruction tuning?\nANSWER: The decision to use decoder-only models has a large impact on instruction tuning, as all models of such size class with fully public model parameters are decoder-only, and the decision is often due to better hardware and software framework support.\n9. QUESTION: What are the limitations of left-to-right causal language modeling as a pretraining objective?\nANSWER: Left-to-right causal language modeling is a suboptimal objective, and Tay et al.

QUESTION: What is the purpose of the edge saliency in the study?\nANSWER: The purpose of the edge saliency in the study is to be leveraged as the weight of neighbor nodes being positive. The study aims to understand the discrepancy in the mechanism between GCL and MLP, despite both models adopting similar frameworks.\n10. QUESTION: What is the conclusion of the study in the text?\nANSWER: The conclusion of the study is that the performance of GCL is still better than the MLP counterpart, which implies that there is a great discrepancy in the mechanism between VCL and GCL, although they adopt seemingly similar frameworks, SIMCLR and GRACE.

    "text": "1. QUESTION: What calibration reference sample did the authors use for their analysis?\nANSWER: The authors employed the fiducial spectroscopic sample described in vdb22 as their calibration reference sample. This sample comprises spectroscopic redshift estimates (spec-zs) from various spectroscopic surveys that overlap with the KIDS fields, enabling the authors to assign KIDS photometric measurements to objects in the reference sample.\n2. QUESTION: How did the authors select the most reliable redshift estimates for the objects in their sample?\nANSWER: The authors defined a specific hierarchy to select the most reliable redshift estimates based on the quality of the measurements. For further details on the adopted spectroscopic samples and the compilation procedure, readers are referred to appendix A of vdb22.\n3. QUESTION: What Som (Stochastic Optimization Method) did the authors use for their calibration?\nANSWER: The authors used a 101x101 hexagonal Som trained on the R-band magnitude and 36 colours derived from the psf-matched, list-driven nine-band ugrizyjhk photometry from the KIDS + VIKING surveys. This Som is identical to the fiducial Som constructed in vdb22.\n4. QUESTION: How did the authors categorize the reference and target samples for their analysis?\nANSWER: The authors segregated the reference and target samples into the trained Som cells separable groupings between the spectroscopic and photometric sources in each bin. During this process, they further categorized the original Som cells using a hierarchical cluster analysis implemented by the ‘hclust' function within the R stats package to increase the number of galaxies per grouping.\n5. QUESTION: What number of clusters per bin did the authors adopt for their analysis?\nANSWER: The authors adopted the same number of clusters per bin (4000, 2200, 2800, 4200, and 2000) as Wright et al. 2020, who determined these numbers using simulations produced by Van den Busch et al. (2020).\n6. QUESTION: What additional selection step did the authors apply to the Som groupings to mitigate the effects of photometric noise and incompleteness of the reference sample?\nANSWER: The authors excluded any grouping where the mean spectroscopic redshift of the reference sample zspec and the mean photometric redshift of the target sample zp exhibited a significant discrepancy, defined as |zspec - zp| > 0.122 mad, where omaa represents the normalized median absolute deviation of all Som groupings, which they calculated to be 0.122 in their case. This step allowed them to define the KIDS ‘gold' sample, which they used to compute the redshift distributions.\n7. QUESTION: How did the authors define the KIDS ‘gold' sample?\nANSWER: The authors defined the KIDS ‘gold' sample as the result of an additional selection step applied to the Som groupings. They excluded any grouping where the mean spectroscopic redshift of the reference sample zspec and the mean photometric redshift of the target sample zp exhibited a significant discrepancy, defined as |zspec - zp| > 0.122 mad.\n8.

    "text": "1. QUESTION: What was the approach used to address systematic uncertainties arising from shear calibration in the study?\nANSWER: The approach used to address systematic uncertainties arising from shear calibration in the study involved two primary steps. In the first step, the potential residual biases after implementing the simulation-based shear calibration were quantified through a sensitivity analysis. In the second step, these systematic uncertainties were propagated into the final uncertainties of the estimated cosmological parameters. The authors proposed a separate accounting of the shear calibration uncertainties, which is considered more accurate and informative than the traditional approach that uses nominal shear calibration uncertainties that are deliberately overestimated to encompass potential systematic uncertainties arising from shear calibration.\n2.

QUESTION: What is the effect of using different types of attention weights on the validation accuracy of GPT-3?\nANSWER: Using different types of attention weights, such as aw and aw, can significantly impact the performance of GPT-3. Adapting both w, and w, results in the best overall performance, while putting all the parameters in aw, or aw, results in lower performance. The standard deviation across random seeds is consistent for a given dataset when adapting both w, and w,.\n2. QUESTION: What is the optimal rank r for Lora?\nANSWER: The optimal rank r for Lora depends on the specific dataset and task. Adapting both w, and w, with a rank of 4 or higher is preferable to adapting a single type of weights with a larger rank. On the GPT-2 dataset, Lora performs competitively with a very small rank r.\n3. QUESTION: How does the rank of the weight matrices affect the performance of Lora?\nANSWER: The rank of the weight matrices affects the performance of Lora, with a smaller rank r being sufficient for adapting both w, and w, on some datasets.

QUESTION: How was the extended results of the e3nnvae model obtained?\nANSWER: The extended results of the e3nnvae model were obtained by aggregating the results over all possible loss terms in LISGOIECLU & are below at log-decreasing clue learning rates. The results were normalized and visualized to cleanly observe the relative loss trends between the different runs.\n5. QUESTION: What was the purpose of normalizing the results before aggregation in the extended results analysis?\nANSWER: The purpose of normalizing the results before aggregation in the extended results analysis was to cleanly visualize the relative loss trends between the different runs. Without this, the raw loss values often exist on drastically different scales, which can obscure the curve slopes.\n6. QUESTION: What was the final pipeline experiment used to observe optimization effects in the e3nnvae model?\nANSWER: The final pipeline experiment used to observe optimization effects in the e3nnvae model was a combination of the training of the e3nnvae and OCS models, followed by clue optimization.\n7. QUESTION: What was the role of the RGCN module in the e3nnvae model?\nANSWER: The RGCN module was used to mix node and edge features of z with all hg via a 2D RGCN module ©, as described in [subsection 2.2 | (Schlichtkrull et al. | / 2017)]. The module contained four 9 molecular conformers, which were optimized by minimization of differentiable uncertainty hidden layers of dimension 128, followed by shiftedsoftplus activation and layer norm.\n8. QUESTION: What was the purpose of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term in the e3nnvae model?\nANSWER: The purpose of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term in the e3nnvae model was to measure the difference between the distribution of the true data and the distribution of the reconstructed data.\n9. QUESTION: What was the purpose of the latent L2-norm loss term in the e3nnvae model?\nANSWER: The purpose of the latent L2-norm loss term in the e3nnvae model was to regularize the model and prevent overfitting.\n10.

    "text": "1. QUESTION: What is the purpose of normalizing the loss terms during training of the clue optimizer?\nANSWER: The purpose of normalizing the loss terms during training of the clue optimizer is to allow other terms to overtake the dominant term (reconstruction loss) in optimization and to control the importance of each term using their weight hyperparameters.\n2. QUESTION: What is the effect of normalizing the loss terms on the overall loss (lasoiec lu e)?\nANSWER: Without normalization, the reconstruction term appears to dominate the overall loss. However, when normalized, other terms are allowed to overtake it, and in most cases, the reconstruction loss actually increases over the clue steps.\n3. QUESTION: What is the effect of normalizing the loss terms on the outcome of the optimization process?\nANSWER: The outcome of the optimization process may or may not be acceptable depending on the application and on the extent of the conformer divergence with increasing £.\n4. QUESTION: What is the purpose of holding the weight hyperparameters at 1.0 for all terms and experiments herein?\nANSWER: The purpose of holding the weight hyperparameters at 1.0 for all terms and experiments herein is to keep all terms on an equal footing and to control the importance of each term using their weight hyperparameters.\n5.

QUESTION: What is the effect of normalizing the loss terms on the conformer optimization process?\nANSWER: Normalizing the loss terms can lead to substantial differences in outcome, particularly in reconstruction (lc, = d, ( x, 20 ) ). Without normalization, this term appears to dominate the overall loss.\n8. QUESTION: What is the effect of normalizing the loss terms on the target loss?\nANSWER: Normalizing the loss terms can lead to substantial differences in outcome, particularly in reconstruction (lc, = d, ( x, 20 ) ).

QUESTION: What is the main purpose of the paper?\nANSWER: The main purpose of the paper is to introduce OpenGSL, a comprehensive benchmark for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Graph Neural Layers (GRLs), and to use this benchmark to compare the performance of twelve state-of-the-art GSL methods on various datasets.\n2. QUESTION: What are the challenges in comparing the results of GSL methods?\nANSWER: There are several challenges in comparing the results of GSL methods, including the use of different datasets, data processing approaches, data splitting strategies, and GNN backbones in previous work, which makes many of the results incomparable, and a lack of understanding of the learned structure itself, particularly regarding its homophily and generalizability to other GNN backbones.\n3. QUESTION: What is the main contribution of the paper?\nANSWER: The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of OpenGSL, the first comprehensive benchmark for GSL, which implements a wide range of GSL algorithms through unified APIs, while also adopting consistent data processing and data splitting approaches for fair comparisons.\n4. QUESTION: What are the findings of the benchmarking of GSL methods on various datasets?\nANSWER: The benchmarking of GSL methods on various datasets reveals that GSL methods do not consistently outperform the vanilla GNNs, and that increasing the homophily of the structure does not necessarily translate into improved performance. The learned structures by GSL methods exhibit strong generalizability, and most GSL methods are time- and memory-inefficient.\n5. QUESTION: What is the homophily of the learned structure?\nANSWER: The homophily of the learned structure refers to the extent to which the nodes in the learned structure are similar to each other.\n6. QUESTION: What is the generalizability of the learned structure across GNN backbones?\nANSWER: The generalizability of the learned structure across GNN backbones refers to the extent to which the learned structure can be applied to different GNN backbones.\n7. QUESTION: What are the potential future directions based on the benchmark findings?\nANSWER: The potential future directions based on the benchmark findings include exploring more efficient GSL approaches, and investigating the relationship between the homophily of the structure and the performance of GSL methods.\n8.

QUESTION: What are the datasets used in the benchmarking of GSL methods?\nANSWER: The benchmarking of GSL methods was conducted on ten popular datasets of diverse types and scales.\n10. QUESTION: What are the limitations of the benchmarking in the paper?\nANSWER: One limitation of the benchmarking in the paper is that it only considers GSL methods that use two-layer GNNs, which may not be representative of all GSL methods. Additionally, the use of different training strategies, spurious connections among nodes, and learning methods may affect the results, and these factors were not fully controlled in the benchmarking.",

    "text": "1. QUESTION: What is the main aim of the paper?\nANSWER: The main aim of the paper is to create a comprehensive benchmark that facilitates the regular evaluation of the efficacy of graph neural network (GNN) models in the field as a whole.\n2. QUESTION: What is the purpose of the benchmark?\nANSWER: The benchmark is designed to provide a standardized and comprehensive evaluation of the performance of different GNN models on a variety of tasks, with the aim of guiding future research in the field.\n3. QUESTION: What are the two formulations and background in the benchmark?\nANSWER: The benchmark includes two formulations and backgrounds: a synthetic benchmark and a real-world benchmark. The synthetic benchmark is based on the Adjacency Matrix (AM) representation, while the real-world benchmark is based on the GraphSAGE representation.\n4. QUESTION: What is the difference between traditional GNNs and GSL methods?\nANSWER: In traditional GNNs, the adjacent matrix (A) only serves as input and is not updated along with the training of GNNs. In GSL methods, a gradually updated structure (S) replaces the original structure (A) and is optimized with respect to the training process. This is the major difference between traditional GNNs and GSL methods.\n5. QUESTION: What are the two key components in GSL methods?\nANSWER: The two key components in GSL methods are the structure learning component and the GNN component. The structure learning component is responsible for learning a gradually updated structure, while the GNN component is responsible for training the GNN model.\n6. QUESTION: What are the different training procedures in GSL methods?\nANSWER: GSL methods can be categorized into three different training procedures: pre-training, co-training, and iter-training. Pre-training involves a two-stage learning process, where the structure is learned through pre-training and then used to train GNNs in downstream tasks. Co-training involves training the two components together, while iter-training involves training the two components iteratively, where the structure is learned from predictions or representations generated by an optimized GNN and used to train a new GNN model for the subsequent iteration.\n7. QUESTION: What is the role of homophily and heterophily in GSL methods?\nANSWER: Homophily and heterophily are two mutually exclusive measurements based on similarity between connected node pairs. Homophily measures the tendency of nodes to connect with similar nodes, while heterophily measures the tendency of nodes to connect with dissimilar nodes. Although homophily has been traditionally associated with GNNs, recent works have argued that heterophily can also play an important role in the training of GNNs.\n8. QUESTION: What are the limitations of the benchmark?\nANSWER: The benchmark has several limitations, including the limited number of tasks and datasets, the focus on a limited number of GNN models, and the lack of a comprehensive comparison with traditional GNN models.\n9. QUESTION: What are the potential future directions for the benchmark?\nANSWER: The authors have outlined potential future directions based on their benchmark findings, including the exploration of different GNN models, the use of more complex benchmarks, and the development of more efficient training procedures.\n10. QUESTION: How can the benchmark facilitate future research in the field?\nANSWER: The benchmark can facilitate future research in the field by providing a standardized and comprehensive evaluation of the performance of different GNN models on a variety of tasks. This can help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different GNN models and guide future research in the field.",

QUESTION: What is the purpose of the study?\nANSWER: The purpose of the study is to investigate the homophily of the learned structures in graph structure learning (GSL) methods and their performance on homophilous and heterophilous datasets.\n2. QUESTION: What is the observation about the homophily of the learned structures in GSL methods?\nANSWER: The observation is that the homophily of the learned structures varies on homophilous and heterophilous datasets. The homophily of the learned structures is scarcely different from the original structure, and in some cases, even lower.\n3. QUESTION: Why is the homophily of the learned structures in GSL methods counterintuitive?\nANSWER: The homophily of the learned structures in GSL methods is counterintuitive because methods like GCN explicitly aim to increase the similarity between the learned structures and the original structure, and in most cases, the performance of the learned structures is significantly improved.\n4. QUESTION: What is the reason for the lack of improvement in homophilous datasets?\nANSWER: The reason for the lack of improvement in homophilous datasets is that the limited number of edges that can be recovered or removed by GSL is limited. Thus, on heterophilous datasets where most edges do not fit the homophily assumption, these limited edges are more likely to be updated.\n5. QUESTION: What is the performance of GSL methods on heterophilous datasets?\nANSWER: The performance of GSL methods on heterophilous datasets is significantly improved in most cases, possibly due to the starting level number of edges that can be recovered or removed by GSL.\n6.

QUESTION: What is the name of the transformer-based generative model that was used in the study?\nANSWER: The name of the transformer-based generative model that was used in the study is \"rope-based transformer\".\n2. QUESTION: How did the rope-based transformer perform compared to the \"poet\" model in terms of generalization to longer context lengths?\nANSWER: The rope-based transformer did not generalize to context lengths beyond the training context length, while the \"poet\" model generalized to ~ 8x the training context length (61k), which is the longest tested.\n3. QUESTION: How did the two models perform on context lengths within the training context length?\nANSWER: The poet model performed better on context lengths within the training context length, but by a small margin.\n4. QUESTION: What was the training context length for the rope-based transformer and poet models?\nANSWER: The training context length for the rope-based transformer was 500k steps, while the training context length for the poet model was 50k or 30k steps respectively.\n5. QUESTION: What did the authors fine-tune the rope-based transformer and poet models with?\nANSWER: The authors finetuned both models with 16k and 32k context lengths for 50k and 30k steps respectively.\n6. QUESTION: How did the perplexity of the transformer improve at the 16k and 32k context lengths?\nANSWER: The perplexity of the transformer improved significantly at the 16k and 32k context lengths, but it still did not generalize to context lengths beyond the training context length and underperformed all variants of poet at all context lengths.\n7. QUESTION: How did the transformer underperform poet for variant fitness prediction?\nANSWER: The transformer underperformed poet for variant fitness prediction, and the large differences in their generative capabilities suggests that the transformer would continue to underperform even with hyperparameter tuning.\n8. QUESTION: What is the \"sequence-of-sequences generative framework\" used by poet?\nANSWER: The \"sequence-of-sequences generative framework\" used by poet allows for training across tens of millions of protein sequence clusters to encode fundamental rules of protein evolution into the poet model.\n9. QUESTION: What is poet used for?\nANSWER: Poet is a transformer-based autoregressive generative model of whole protein families. It can be used as a retrieval-augmented language model, generating new sequences conditioned on a set of sequences representing the family or other properties of interest.\n10. QUESTION: What are the benefits of using poet for protein design?\nANSWER: Poet can improve over other protein language models and evolutionary sequence models for variant function prediction across a wide range of deep mutational scanning datasets, especially for proteins with shallow MSAS, variants with large numbers of simultaneous mutations, and insertions and deletions. It can be backed by other sequence databases and naturally improves as databases grow without the need for retraining. As a result, it is anticipated that poet will become a fundamental component of ML-enabled protein design in the future.",

    "text": "1. QUESTION: How can PoET identify the subset of relevant homologs for a specific target protein of interest?\nANSWER: PoET can identify the subset of relevant homologs for a specific target protein of interest by using a process that is tailored to the target protein.

    "text": "1. QUESTION: What is Bohmian mechanics?\nANSWER: Bohmian mechanics is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that proposes that particles have a definite position in space, even when in a superposition of states. It suggests that the wave function guides the motion of particles, and that the act of measurement does not cause a collapse of the wave function, but merely provides information about the pre-existing reality.\n2. QUESTION: What is the de Broglie-Bohm theory?\nANSWER: The de Broglie-Bohm theory is similar to Bohmian mechanics, but it also assumes that all particles in the universe are connected by a hidden variable, and that the motion of one particle determines the motion of all other particles.\n3. QUESTION: What is the pilot-wave theory?\nANSWER: The pilot-wave theory proposes that particles have a wave-like property that guides their motion through space. It assumes that the wave function does not collapse, but rather that the wave guides the motion of particles.\n4. QUESTION: What is the Copenhagen interpretation?\nANSWER: The Copenhagen interpretation is one of the most widely accepted interpretations of quantum mechanics. It proposes that the wave function of a particle collapses upon measurement, and that the act of measurement itself determines the outcome.\n5. QUESTION: What is the many-worlds interpretation?\nANSWER: The many-worlds interpretation proposes that every time a measurement is made, the universe splits into multiple parallel universes, with each possible outcome occurring in a different universe.\n6. QUESTION: What is the transactional interpretation?\nANSWER: The transactional interpretation proposes that the act of measurement itself is a transaction between the observer and the observed, and that the wave function collapses as a result of this transaction.\n7. QUESTION: What is the consciousness-causes-collapse interpretation?\nANSWER: The consciousness-causes-collapse interpretation proposes that consciousness itself is what causes the wave function to collapse, and that the act of measurement is simply a reflection of this consciousness.\n8. QUESTION: What is the information-gain interpretation?\nANSWER: The information-gain interpretation proposes that the act of measurement provides information about the state of the system being observed, but that the wave function does not collapse.\n9. QUESTION: What is the stochastic interpretation?\nANSWER: The stochastic interpretation proposes that the wave function collapses randomly, with each possible outcome having an equal probability of occurring.\n10. QUESTION: What is the many-minds interpretation?\nANSWER: The many-minds interpretation proposes that each possible outcome of a measurement occurs in a different universe, with each universe having its own set of observers.",
