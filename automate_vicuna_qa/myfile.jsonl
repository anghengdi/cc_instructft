   {"question": "What is the impact of research on pretraining corpora, architectures, and pretraining objectives on instruction tuning?", "answer": "The continuing advancement in research on the pretraining corpora, architectures, and pretraining objectives of LMS has a large impact on instruction tuning. As of 2022, decoder-only left-to-right causal transformers dominate the market of models larger than 100b, and all models of such size class with fully public model parameters are decoder-only."},
   {"question": "What is the decision-making process for choosing between decoder-only and fully public model parameters in LMS?", "answer": "The decision of which model to choose is often due to better hardware and software framework support, but Raffel et al. (2020), Lewis et al. (2020), and Tay et al. (2022a) have consistently found that left-to-right causal language modeling is a suboptimal objective, and Tay et al. (2022b) and Wang et al.

   {"question": "What are the major developments in instruction tuning outlined in Section 2?", "answer": "The major developments in instruction tuning include the prospect of complementing or replacing few-shot in-context learning, which is the currently predominant method of evaluating pretrained and instruction-tuned models, with parameter-efficient tuning."},
   {"question": "What is the prospect of complementing or replacing few-shot in-context learning in instruction tuning?", "answer": "The prospect of complementing or replacing few-shot in-context learning with parameter-efficient tuning is promising, as updating a small subset of model parameters can reach comparable performance as fully tuning all model parameters."},
   {"question": "What are the challenges of standard finetuning of models larger than 100b?", "answer": "The standard finetuning of models larger than 100b requires a high number of accelerators with the right interconnects, which is often too expensive even for many industry labs, leading to the need for parameter-efficient tuning."},
   {"question": "What is the relationship between pretraining corpora, instruction tuning, and downstream abilities?", "answer": "The relationship between pretraining corpora, instruction tuning, and downstream abilities remains under-explored, and typically, public models are trained on one of a few public corpora: C4 (Raffel et al., 2020), the pile (Gao et al., 2020), or Roots (Laurencon et al., 2022)."},
   {"question": "What are the important developments in instruction tuning?", "answer": "The important developments in instruction tuning include the prospect of complementing or replacing few-shot in-context learning, the challenges of standard finetuning of models larger than 100b, and the relationship between pretraining corpora, instruction tuning, and downstream abilities."},
   {"question": "What is the impact of the decision to use decoder-only models on instruction tuning?", "answer": "The decision to use decoder-only models has a large impact on instruction tuning, as all models of such size class with fully public model parameters are decoder-only, and the decision is often due to better hardware and software framework support."},
   {"question": "What are the limitations of left-to-right causal language modeling as a pretraining objective?", "answer": "Left-to-right causal language modeling is a suboptimal objective, and Tay et al.
