## Introduction 

We want to be able to finetune [**Vicuna LLM**](https://chat.lmsys.org/) on documents to learn domain knowledge/words for question-answering (QA) purposes.

To achieve that, we plan to create a QA dataset to finetune the Vicuna base model.

## Creating dataset

In order to fine-tune the base model to be able to understand and answer queries based on army documents, we will need to create a QA dataset with relevant questions.

We are given the army documents in the form of a PDF file.
